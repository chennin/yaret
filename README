A Unix system with Perl, MySQL, and a Web server is required.  The following
Perl modules are also required. If you do not have them, install them via CPAN
or your distribution's package manager if available:

* JSON::XS
* LWP::UserAgent
* POSIX 
* DateTime
* CGI
* File::Temp
* Config::Simple
* DBD::mysql
* File::Temp
* Time::HiRes
* File::Copy
* File::Basename

INSTALL:

1. Make sure you have Perl, MySQL, and the above Perl modules installed
  * Ubuntu 14.04 quick start: 
      apt-get update
      apt-get install mysql-server lighttpd libjson-xs-perl libwww-perl \
         libdatetime-perl libconfig-simple-perl

2. Create a database (example: "yaret") and DB user (example: "yaret").
3. Import yaret-initial.sql into this database. Example:
        mysql -u yaret -p yaret < yaret-initial.sql
4. Move ret.conf.dist to ret.conf and fill in the values.
5. Create a destination (example: /var/www/rift/) and make sure it is:
   * Owned by the system user that will be running the script (don't use root)
   * Readable by the system user your Web server runs as (ex: www-data)
6. Add a cron job to run events.pl. Example:
        * * * * * /home/alucard/rift/events.pl

HTML files for each datacenter (na and eu) are generated and put under
/var/www/rift/ by default. You can change this destination by editing 
ret.conf.  Include a trailing slash.

Thanks to RiftPluz for collecting most of the translations in one place.
